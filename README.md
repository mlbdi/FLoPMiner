# FLoPMiner

Abstract

Perceiving resident movements from ubiquitous sensor devices can aid health and safety management in smart home environment. One can find resident movement patterns to get notification about what should be aware of to prepare for possible accidents. The goal of this work is to propose a method to search for periodic residents’ activity patterns given smart home applications. Specifically, the proposed method is aimed to capture fuzzy local periodic activity patterns (FLPAP) from the smart home data. A FLPAP is an activity pattern that periodically occurs for a particular duration in fuzzy time intervals. We construct an algorithm to help to find the FLPAP called Fuzzy Local Periodic Activity Pattern Miner (FLoPMiner). On the side, a parameter called -scale period is well-chosen to reorganize the data to make it suitable for the need of periodic activity pattern mining. The proposed method was demonstrated for its effectiveness on a public smart home dataset. After all, we successfully retrieved periodic resident activity patterns, which can be applied to self-health management systems, especially when focusing on a precise scale period. Overall, the proposed method shows descent pattern representation against the state-of-the-art methods of the same category.
